# NEXUS: Adaptive AI Automation System

## Project Overview

NEXUS is an advanced AI automation system designed to learn and adapt instead of following rigid rules. It represents a paradigm shift in how AI interacts with computer systems, focusing on adaptation, learning from experience, and cross-application intelligence. The system combines multiple AI technologies including large language models, computer vision, and automation tools to create an assistant that can control and interact with various applications while continuously improving through experience.

## Core Philosophy

The fundamental philosophy of NEXUS is **"adaptation over rigid rules"**. This means:

1. The system learns from experience rather than following predefined patterns
2. It adapts to available resources and capabilities
3. It improves over time through continuous learning
4. It transfers knowledge between different applications and contexts

## Architecture Components

### 1. Multi-Specialist AI Architecture

NEXUS employs a multi-specialist AI architecture with coordinated reasoning:

- **CoordinatorAI**: The central orchestrator that decomposes tasks, assigns them to specialists, and synthesizes results
- **VisionAI**: Specializes in image analysis, OCR, and UI element detection
- **ResearchAI**: Handles web searches, knowledge retrieval, and content analysis
- **AutomationAI**: Executes actions, UI interactions, and system tasks

These specialists work together through a shared memory system, allowing for coordinated problem-solving across different domains.

### 2. Adaptive Integration Layer

The system includes a sophisticated integration layer that manages multiple AI service providers:

- **API Integration Manager**: Dynamically discovers and registers API service providers
- **Provider-Specific Adapters**: Standardizes interactions with different LLM providers (Ollama, Groq, Hugging Face, etc.)
- **Capability Mapping**: Tracks which providers support which capabilities
- **Performance Metrics**: Records and learns from the performance of different providers

This allows NEXUS to adapt to available AI services and select the optimal provider for each task.
