# UI Detection Framework

## Overview

The UI Detection Framework is a core component of AI.NEXUS that enables the system to detect and interact with UI elements on the screen.

## Architecture

### Components

- **Detector Interface**: Defines the common interface for all detection algorithms
- **YOLO Detector**: Implements object detection using YOLO
- **Template Matcher**: Implements detection using template matching
- **Element Classifier**: Classifies detected elements by type

### Workflow

1. Capture screen
2. Preprocess image
3. Detect UI elements
4. Classify elements
5. Return structured results

## Implementation Considerations

- Performance is critical for real-time detection
- Must support multiple detection algorithms
- Should be extensible for future improvements

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for the full workflow
- Performance benchmarks
