# NEXUS Features & Implementation Tracking

This document serves as the central reference for all NEXUS features, both implemented and planned. It helps maintain a comprehensive overview of the system's capabilities and ensures no feature overlap or duplication.

## Core Philosophy

**"The AI should learn and adapt instead of following rigid rules."**

NEXUS is built on an AI-orchestrated tool integration architecture where:

1. The AI autonomously selects, combines, and orchestrates tools without hard-coded paths
2. AI creates new tool combinations dynamically based on task requirements
3. Tools register with a central registry that the AI can discover and utilize
4. Web search capabilities allow the AI to learn new approaches and gather information
5. Success/failure tracking automatically optimizes tool selection over time
6. The AI can suggest new libraries or tools to enhance capabilities
7. Interactive learning allows the AI to ask clarifying questions when uncertain
8. Memory systems store successful patterns and user preferences for personalization
