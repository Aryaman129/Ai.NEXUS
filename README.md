# AI.NEXUS

An advanced AI automation system designed to learn and adapt instead of following rigid rules. This project is a collaborative effort between three AI assistants (Augment, Cursor, and WindSurf) with minimal human intervention.

## Project Overview

AI.NEXUS is an implementation of an adaptive AI system with a focus on clean architecture, comprehensive documentation, and AI-driven development. It represents a paradigm shift in how AI interacts with computer systems, focusing on adaptation, learning from experience, and cross-application intelligence.

## Core Philosophy

The fundamental philosophy of AI.NEXUS is **"adaptation over rigid rules"**. This means:

1. The system learns from experience rather than following predefined patterns
2. It adapts to available resources and capabilities
3. It improves over time through continuous learning
4. It transfers knowledge between different applications and contexts

## AI Collaboration

This project is collaboratively developed by three AI assistants:

- **Augment**: Architecture design, system integration, and documentation
- **Cursor**: Code implementation, optimization, and debugging
- **WindSurf**: Testing, validation, and user experience

## Getting Started

See the [documentation](docs/) for more information on how to get started with AI.NEXUS.
