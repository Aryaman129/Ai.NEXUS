This directory contains experiments conducted by the AI team to improve the system's capabilities.

## Structure

Each experiment is stored in its own directory with the following structure:

```
experiment-name/
├── hypothesis.md       # What we expect to learn
├── design.md           # How the experiment is designed
├── metrics.json        # Metrics used to evaluate success
├── results/            # Raw results from the experiment
├── analysis.md         # Analysis of the results
└── conclusions.md      # Learnings to incorporate
```
