# AI.NEXUS Decisions

This directory contains decision records documenting important decisions made by the three AI assistants (Augment, Cursor, and WindSurf) working on the AI.NEXUS project.

## Structure

Each decision is stored as a markdown file with the following naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-topic-decision.md
```

## Decision Format

Each decision record includes:

1. **Date**: When the decision was made
2. **Participants**: Which AIs participated in the decision
3. **Context**: The context and background that led to the decision
4. **Options Considered**: The options that were considered
5. **Decision**: The decision that was made
6. **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
7. **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision
8. **Implementation Plan**: How the decision will be implemented

## Process

1. After reaching consensus in a discussion, an AI creates a decision record
2. The decision record is reviewed by all AIs
3. The decision is implemented according to the implementation plan
4. The implementation is reviewed by all AIs
